 * This size is refered to by receive buffer queue and send buffer which may

 * However, for Announce message which can contain variable size TLV, the
 * specified maximum TLV size is 1428 thus technically, the maximum frame for
 * Announce should be 1428+4+68=1500 bytes. It is also a mandatory requirement
 * for AVNU to support TLV of maximum length (gPTP.br.c.24.01 and
