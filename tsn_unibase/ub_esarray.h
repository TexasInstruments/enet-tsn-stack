 * @{
 * @file ub_esarray.h
 *
 * @brief Allocated memory array which is expanded or shrinked automatically
 *
 * How it expands and shrinks is defined by 'ub_esarray_init' call.
 * The first allocation happens at the call of 'ub_esarray_init'.
 * 'ub_esarray_close' must be called at the end to free all the allocated area.
 *
 * To use as a fifo, push data by 'ub_esarray_add_ele', and pop data by
 * 'ub_esarray_pop_ele'.  The contents of data element is copied each time.
 *
 * To use as a lifo(stack), push data by 'ub_esarray_add_ele', and pop data by
 * 'ub_esarray_pop_last_ele'.  The contents of data element is copied each time.
 *
 * To avoid copying data, data pointer and data index can be used.
 * But such use can't be thread safe.  To be thread safe, data must be
 * locked by calling 'ub_esarray_data_lock' during the time of using
 * the pointers or the index numbers, and must be unlocked by calling
 * 'ub_esarray_data_unlock' after that.
