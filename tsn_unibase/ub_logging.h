 * @brief Control logging by levels and categories.
 *
 * The logging is controlled by 8 levels which is from UBL_NONE to UBL_DEBUGV.
 * The levels are used, one is for regular console output,
 * and the other is for debug output.
 *
 * The two levels are set for each category.
 * The categories are defined by user applications, and need to be registered
 * by the initialization string.
 * Registered categories must be enumerated and managed by user.
 * Because category number 0 is used for 'unibase', in user applications
 * starting from category number 1 is recommended.
